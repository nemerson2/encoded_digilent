# encoded_digilent
This package includes code for reading positional encoders using an Arduino, reading the scope off of an Analog Discovery 3 from Digilent, syncing the two sources of data, and saving into an excel. It was created originally for taking ultrasound measurements but could easily be applied to other sensor types.
